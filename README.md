## Overview

This repository contains an HR analysis based on a dataset of employees from various departments, business units, and locations. The analysis includes calculating average ages, distribution of employees by department and city, and average salaries by country and business unit. The visualization and analysis are performed using Power BI.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following fields:

- **EEID**: Employee ID
- **Full Name**: Employee's Full Name
- **Job Title**: Employee's Job Title
- **Department**: Department in which the employee works
- **Business Unit**: Business unit to which the employee belongs
- **Gender**: Employee's gender
- **Age**: Employee's age
- **Hire Date**: Date the employee was hired
- **Annual Salary**: Employee's annual salary
- **Bonus %**: Employee's bonus percentage
- **Country**: Country where the employee is located
- **City**: City where the employee is located
- **End Date**: End date of the employee's employment (if applicable)

## Analysis

### 1. Average Age for Each Job Title

We calculate the average age for each job title to understand the age distribution across different roles.

### 2. Distribution of Employees by Department and City

We create a distribution table to show the count of employees in each department within different cities.

### 3. Average Salary by Country and Business Unit

We determine the average salary by grouping the data by country and business unit to understand salary differences across regions and business functions.
